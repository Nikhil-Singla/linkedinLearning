This folder contains courses from LinkedIn Learning that I have discontinued from learning due to them being not aligned with my current learning goals.

As a dedicated learner, I believe in the importance of continuous education and development. However, I also recognize the value of focusing my efforts on 
courses that will have a direct impact on my career goals.

While I have discontinued these courses, I am happy to discuss my learning journey and provide more information on the courses I have completed and the skills I have acquired..
