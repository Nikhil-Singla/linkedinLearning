Simply put, a programming language is a way of providing instructions to a computer to get it to do things for us. 

Computers, at their core, really only understand electrical signals, and code that directly interacts with the processing 
hardware on your computer is called machine language.

Low level code is abstract, higher level code is more easier to read and write. Python and JavaScript are high level and lower 
are useful in working with hardware.

Programming Paradigm is just an agreed upon approach to writing and organizing your code. Eg: object-oriented programming and functional programming. 

Object-oriented programming involves organizing your code into individual classes which combine state and behavior. Class = blueprint, code instantiates these blueprints 
as objects. Objects can send messages to each other, but they don't need to know what is actually happening inside. 
Functional programming involves organizing your code into pure functions that always return the same result and avoid side effects. A necessary feature of functional 
programs is that functions are first-class objects, which means that they can be stored as variables and passed to  and returned from other functions. 

Basic differences include code blocks (indent vs curly braces) and how their variables are declared (dynamic typing but JS has let and const since 2015)
