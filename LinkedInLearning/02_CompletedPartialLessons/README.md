# Completed Partial Learning

The notes contained in this section represent my best effort to summarize and retain the key takeaways from the courses I have completed. Nonetheless, These courses were started with a specific purpose in mind, and once that purpose was fulfilled, for the remaining material my attention may have waned towards the end.

This folder contains notes from courses that still I have completed while also achieving my original learning goals. 

As a lifelong learner, I am committed to acquiring knowledge and skills that are relevant to my career goals. And from every course, I have still gained valuable knowledge and insights that can be applied to my work.
