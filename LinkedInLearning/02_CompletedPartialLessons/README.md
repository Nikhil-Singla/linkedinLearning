# Completed (Partial) Learning

This section contains notes that represent my best effort to summarize and retain the key takeaways from courses I have completed. 
However, these courses were started with a specific purpose in mind, and once that purpose was fulfilled, my attention towards the remaining material may have waned.
As a lifelong learner, I am committed to acquiring knowledge and skills that are relevant to my career goals. I believe that every course provides valuable knowledge and insights that can be applied to my work, and I have made a conscious effort to retain and summarize the key takeaways from each course.
