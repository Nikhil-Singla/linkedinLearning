Enterprise Architecture (EA) refers to the structure of a business, encompassing its processes and software infrastructure. It's important that the software and infrastructure 
reflect the business model to ensure efficient operations. However, the approach to EA can lead to bloated and complex systems that are difficult to maintain, hindering its 
intended cost-saving benefits. The tendency towards standardization can result in unnecessary complexity and systems that are difficult to understand. Agile systems tend to 
be small, standalone collections of systems that cooperate with each other. EA can lead to enormous databases and complex systems that nobody fully understands, making it a 
failed approach from an agile perspective.

Design patterns originated from Christopher Alexander's work on successful building architecture, and are a set of possible designs or implementations that are discovered, 
not invented. They can interact in complex ways, and understanding them is useful for software development by providing a well-understood underlying architecture. Examples 
of design patterns include creational, structural, and behavioral patterns, such as the Singleton, Adapter, and Observer patterns. They provide a common vocabulary for 
developers to communicate and collaborate more effectively, allowing developers to focus on implementing unique features while relying on established structures that have 
been proven to work. By applying design patterns, developers can write more efficient, maintainable, and scalable code.
