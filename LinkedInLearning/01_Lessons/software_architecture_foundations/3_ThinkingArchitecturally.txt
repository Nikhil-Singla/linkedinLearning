In software development, what are problem statements and user stories and how do they contribute to creating an architecture?
Problem statements describe the problem of the end-user in terms of the problem domain and its solution. They need to be long enough to capture the problem but don't need 
to capture all the details. User stories describe an end user going through a domain-level process to achieve a valuable outcome. They don't describe a computer program but 
instead focus on the user's work. Both problem statements and user stories contribute to creating an architecture by helping developers to understand the problem and how to 
solve it. They provide valuable insights into what users want, what their goals are, and what would be valuable to them. By focusing on the user's perspective and needs, 
developers can build a system that solves real-world problems and provides actual value.

In agile development, user stories are often too large to fully implement and deploy in a couple of days. The process of making a story smaller is called slicing, but horizontal 
slicing, which describes the UI, business logic, and data persistence separately, is an anti-pattern because it doesn't create a usable implementation for end users. Vertical 
slicing, on the other hand, narrows the scope of a story by identifying potential workflows and removing alternative workflows. Workflow isolation is a common approach to 
narrowing, where every complete single path through a flowchart of activities is a potential narrowed story. Once the stories are narrowed down, the next step is to figure 
out what the architecture will look like.

In this section, the speaker discusses the process of identifying agents (which can become classes, subsystems, or microservices depending on the architectural pattern chosen) and t
heir communication patterns using a technique called event storming. The first step in event storming is to identify domain-level events that are meaningful to the business and lay 
them out in time sequence on sticky notes. Then, the associated work for each event is identified and added to the map using a different color of sticky note to indicate that it is 
an action rather than an event. The next step is to label each action note with the name of the agent that is responsible for it using sticky notes in a third color. The speaker 
also mentions the importance of collaborating with businesspeople and developers throughout this process. Finally, the speaker identifies bounded contexts for each agent and 
draws horizontal lines across the agent notes to indicate them. The resulting map provides a coherent architecture that is implementable and prevents the system from descending 
into chaos. The speaker also mentions creating an artifact that shows the agents and their communication paths using index cards and yarn, which is similar to a class diagram in 
object-oriented programming.
