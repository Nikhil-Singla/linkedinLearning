Code writing = Handling of information
Eg. Game (score), Bankapp (balance) etc.
Variable: Container for a value. Space in memory where we put data as a reference.
Labelled: Giving name and setting value. (Assigning the value done w/ "=" or the assignment operator)
Equal -> Value on right stored on left. Doesn't mean two sides are equal.
Variables represent different datatypes. Datatype allows to put variables in different categories.
Integer is whole number, no decimal. Letters and numbers = String. Check type using the type function.
int, str = Integer, String

Def variable and type before use = Java, C# and C++. Declare type, variable name.
Strict programming language = Cannot reassing datatype using assignment operator.
Python is not, as its possible to use the variable at the same time as declaring it.
Relaxed Languages = Flexible + Less code
Strict Languages = Fewer surprises/bugs on runtime

Rules: Only letters, numbers and underscores and no numbers at start.
No spaces and case sensitive and cannot be keywords.
import keywords
print(keyword.kwlist) to get all the keywords.
Short, descriptive names to make things easy to understand.

Programming is a lot about numbers.
Python treats them based on difference if the number is whole or fractional.
python3 command line to start command.
** = Exponents      (Exponential growth)
// = Floor division (Whole number portion)
% = modulo operator (Remainder portion)
Never use commas with numbers. Javascript has no distinctions for with or without decimal places.
Other languages = Float (Floating point integer) ie number with a decimal place [Precision by python in extra spaces]

Name, address and Emojis = Strings
String of characters (character, number, symbol and space) 
Represented by " " 
Strings can be passed directly or stored in variables
print("Hi") or a = "Hi"; print(a) is same. '' also work in python for Strings
Difference is in the content of strings. Invalid syntax = nested double quotes.
Use single quotes to distinguish.  Mix of quotes is also a syntax error.

Python doesn't count whitespaces. Spend more time understanding/reading code than writing.
Right click anywhere and run python file in terminal.
Input function takes some user input and stores it in a variable.
Whitespace matters when related to the special 30 keywords

["Virtual Sticky-Notes"] Comments: Describe what code does. (Helps in larger programs that cannot be kept in head)
Main purpose - Document the code, add examples and know about function/classes.
Start with #. Line colors green = Comment.
- No impact on output of the code.

Also help temp ignore code by "commenting it out".
Summary: Serve as reminders, Debugging, Provide explanations for others.

Chapter Quiz: 
Python treats all numbers the same, regardless of numerical value. ANS: FALSE

Although Python ignores empty lines, one place where whitespace does make a difference is inside of _____. ANS: special keywords

What is the output of this Python code?. ANS: Jeff
first_name = "Jeff"
first_Name = "Sara"
print(first_name)

How would you fix the following code to return the remainder of 1,000 divided by 300? 1,000 % 300. ANS: 1000 % 300

What will the following code print? variable = "12" '\n' print(type(variable)). ANS: str
