Crucial to business success to have a good underlying architecture.
Architecture is the link between development process and implementation.

What is Software Architecture?
- Architect (Noun) : Designer of complete systems
Software architecture refers to the design of the structure of a system, without including specific implementation details. 
While some people may view software architecture as simply assembling pre-made components, it's more about considering the needs of the customers 
and the business they operate in, beginning with the customer's problem and working downwards towards the implementation. 
The technology used for implementation is considered last, and the best software architects have honed their skills over time, 
including years of experience as programmers, to develop a sense of aesthetics. The aesthetics of software architecture are important, and 
it takes a great deal of experience to develop good judgment.
