Bug: Something unexpected happens
Crash: Stops early or freezes
Computer instructions are sequential and very specific.

Each programming language has its own syntax (rules) and its own semantics (meaning).
Different languages have different functions ranging from simple calculations to deep and complex AI.
High level languages are closer to human languages, easier to learn through structure and syntax so it can be converted into machine language which is just 1's and 0's

Source code: Instructions for computer in plain text.
Word process applications are unsuitable, use a text editor (Notepad/Text Edit/external editor)
Never use rich text format as bold/italics are improper for programming. Plain text is fine.
Use extension of the programming language while saving. To convert to machine language, we need a compiler/interpreter or both.

Compiler: High Level ---(converted)---> Low Level Machine code. (Eg. C++ and C)
Interpreter: Process source code line by line, and needed to run the code everytime by re-interpreting. (Eg. Javascript and PHP)
Combination: Java, C# and Python. [Methods from both Compiled and Interpreted Languages]

IDE: Integrated Development Environment [Make writing code faster by providing special tools and features]
[Eg. Visual Studio Code and XCode]
