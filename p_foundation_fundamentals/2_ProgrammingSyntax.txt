Popular + Easy to Learn = Course Language
5 Most Popular:
Java, C++, C#, Python, Javascript

Python and Javascript = Concise, Fewer Syntax Requirements and easier to understand. 
Javascript: Work and Manipulate webpages/web-applications or some non-web applications.
Python: General Purpose - Web Apps, Company tools, scientific analysis and create games.
Python is also available on all 3 major platforms.

Mac comes shipped with Python. Check version -> Terminal app (Work in directories and execute scripts; Work with Python.) 
Terminal: Utilities/Cmd+Space. 
python (gives version of python). 
Print out - Display result of command on screen.
Version number: New features/changes/impact on language.
Inside python prompt: ">>>"
exit() function to exit terminal/install latest version using wizard from .org page for python3
python.org/downloads for the latest version of python (installer, using wizard)

Python on windows via their website. 
Version number: New features/changes/impact on language.
Executable version.

Run python using command line/Python interpreter.
Syntax = Rules of programming language.
Syntax error = Errors breaking the expected rules (writing code in plain English)
CRTL+D = Shortcut exit
cd = Change Directory
ls = List command
python3 <name_of_file.py>

Python shell = Python interpreter
python <name_of_file.py>
dir = Directory

VSCode is an IDE. Download, Zip folder -> Applications, Open the app.
Learn -> Interface Overview [Learn yourself!]
Need python extension -> Tools -> "Languages" -> Python, and then restart.
Interpreter is needed to be installed using Command Pallete and then Python Interpreter

Download -> Executable (Installation file) -> Launch

File -> Open Folder -> Chose files.
.vscode = Temp folder for storing metadata.
Line numbers is also called as the Gutter
Use color = Syntax highlighting to print out special key words.
Occurs using the file extension. We can run one single line as well using right click menu.

Statement = Building blocks of programms, individual actions taken.
Made of Keywords, Expressions and Operators.
Operators = Symbols that tell computer to perform actions with some input.
Ex. +, -, * and / for Arithemetic Operators.
Inputs aka Operands.
Expressions = Combination of operator and operands that break down into a single value
Result is evaluated or equal to.
Programming has PEMDAS. MD and AS goes from left to right.
Unexpected behaviour otherwise. Use parenthesis otherwise.
Programms made up of statements that do stuff, Math calculations and other stuff.

Programms have bugs. 
Need to understand type of bug/error: 3 Types
1) Syntax - Broke the rules of the language. Eg: print(Hello World) in python
2) Runtime - Computer was unable to execute the portion of your code. Eg: 10 * (2/0) in python
3) Semantic - Output doesn't match the expected output. Eg: name = "Alice"; print("Hello name") doesn't work in python
Best way to know about runtime errors is to look it up on StackOverflow or similar
Semantic are most challenge to troubleshoot. Make tiny changes/do physical activity to let the blood flow before coming back
Laugh and keep moving forward!

To get Python code suggestions, you need to tell VS Code which Python interpreter to use: True
Which concern could be considered a disadvantage of Python under certain circumstances?: General purpose language
Why does VS Code need a Python interpreter to be specified?: To provide code suggestions
When working with the Terminal inside of VSCode, how can you expand the pane?: Click the up arrow.
Which is an example of a runtime error?: name = "It's me!" ; print("Hello.", Name)
