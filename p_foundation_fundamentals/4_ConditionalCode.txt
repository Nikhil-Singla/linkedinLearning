Things are absolute in computer. Only True or False ['1' or '0']
Expression having only 2 outputs is called a conditional or boolean expression.
Relational Operators: Help create conditions. Work on 2 operands and return true/false based on the relation.

'==' : Equality Operator
Make sure to not use '=' when using relational operators.
Most common way for computers is using an "if" statement.

if <condition>
    <do work if true>
end if
EG: 

if 5 < 6:   # ":" is part of the python syntax
    print("Yes 5 is less than 6.")

Code that has been grouped together by the means of identation forms a block. Each statement is the part of the block until the line isn't indented anymore.
Python requires the identation after the if statement or it throws the identation error. It needs 4 spaces for indenting/ 1 tab space.

If-Else statement has just one more else statement with a colon and an else block.
AKA Else clause as we don't find it without the accompanying IF statement.
Else works when the condition of if statement evaluates to false.
We skip over the body of the if statement if the code doesn't evaluate to true.

Syntax is different for all languages. Javascript instead uses ( ) for the "if" condition and { } to surround the if block. Identation isn't necessary either.
Ruby works similarly, except no parenthesis or even colon. Just separate lines and addition of the end keyword.\

Chapter Quiz: 

With if-else statements, we will always execute one of the code blocks depending on the result of the condition test. ANS - TRUE

What is the issue with the following code?. ANS - The conditional statement is checking for equality.
number = input("Enter a number: ")
if number == 10:
    print("The number is greater than 10.")
else:
    print("The number is less than 10.") 
# NOT - The input statement cannot accept numbers.
