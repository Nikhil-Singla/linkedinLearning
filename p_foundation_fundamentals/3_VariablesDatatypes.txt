Variable: Container for a value. Space in memory where we put data as a reference.
Labelled: Giving name and setting value. (Assigning the value done w/ "=" or the assignment operator)
Equal -> Value on right stored on left. Doesn't mean two sides are equal.
Variables represent different datatypes. Datatype allows to put variables in different categories.
Integer is whole number, no decimal. Letters and numbers = String. Check type using the type function.
int, str = Integer, String
