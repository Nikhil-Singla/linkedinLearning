Code writing = Handling of information
Eg. Game (score), Bankapp (balance) etc.
Variable: Container for a value. Space in memory where we put data as a reference.
Labelled: Giving name and setting value. (Assigning the value done w/ "=" or the assignment operator)
Equal -> Value on right stored on left. Doesn't mean two sides are equal.
Variables represent different datatypes. Datatype allows to put variables in different categories.
Integer is whole number, no decimal. Letters and numbers = String. Check type using the type function.
int, str = Integer, String

Def variable and type before use = Java, C# and C++. Declare type, variable name.
Strict programming language = Cannot reassing datatype using assignment operator.
Python is not, as its possible to use the variable at the same time as declaring it.
Relaxed Languages = Flexible + Less code
Strict Languages = Fewer surprises/bugs on runtime

Rules: Only letters, numbers and underscores and no numbers at start.
No spaces and case sensitive and cannot be keywords.
import keywords
print(keyword.kwlist) to get all the keywords.
Short, descriptive names to make things easy to understand.

Programming is a lot about numbers.
Python treats them based on difference if the number is whole or fractional.
python3 command line to start command.
** = Exponents      (Exponential growth)
// = Floor division (Whole number portion)
% = modulo operator (Remainder portion)
Never use commas with numbers. Javascript has no distinctions for with or without decimal places.
Other languages = Float (Floating point integer) ie number with a decimal place [Precision by python in extra spaces]
